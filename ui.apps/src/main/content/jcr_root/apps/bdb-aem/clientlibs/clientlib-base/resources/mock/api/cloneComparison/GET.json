CD126 is an 80 kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein, also known as gp80 and B cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2) Receptor. The IL-6Rα subunit associates with the 130-160 kDa gp130 subunit (IL-6 Receptor β chain, CD130), that is shared with the receptor complexes for Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), Ciliary Neurotropic Factor (CNTF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IL-11, Cardiotropin 1 (CT-1) and possibly Neurotrophin-1/B Cell-Stimulating Factor 3 (NNT-1/BSF-3). The IL-6Rα chain binds IL-6 with low affinity| however the association with CD130 stabilizes the IL-6/IL-6Rα complex resulting in the formation of a high affinity ligand-receptor complex. The IL-6Rβ chain mediates signal transduction. CD126 is expressed at high levels by activated and EBV-transformed B cells, plasma cells and myeloma cells and at lower levels by most leucocytes, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes and neural cells. IL-6Rα exists in soluble form in human serum. The serum levels of soluble IL-6Rα appear to elevate in pathological situations such as multiple myeloma, Grave\u0027s disease, juvenile chronic arthritis and HIV.
